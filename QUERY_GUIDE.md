# Query Guide

This app works best when the **Research Topic** is written as a clear goal statement. A strong pattern is:

> **"I want to write a thesis/proposal/paper about _[topic]_ in _[domain/context]_, focusing on _[scope/constraint]_, using _[method]_, during _[timeframe]_."**

**Best Practices**
- Start with a single primary topic.
- Use a goal-oriented sentence (thesis/proposal/paper/etc.).
- Add scope: domain, population, geography, or application.
- Add constraints: timeframe, methods, data sources, or evaluation focus.
- Include common synonyms or alternative terms if they appear in the literature.

**Good Examples**
- I want to write a thesis about using agent-based modeling in health economics, focusing on policy evaluation and cost-effectiveness.
- I want to write a proposal about LLM-based clinical decision support in radiology, focusing on safety, accuracy, and regulation (2019-2024).
- I want to write a paper about graph neural networks for molecular property prediction, focusing on benchmarks and generalization.
- I want to write a thesis about privacy-preserving federated learning in healthcare, focusing on threat models and mitigation strategies.
- I want to write a proposal about carbon capture using metal-organic frameworks, focusing on adsorption mechanisms and scalability.

**Rewrite These**
1. Bad: "AI in healthcare"
   Better: "I want to write a thesis about LLM-based clinical decision support in radiology, focusing on safety, accuracy, and regulation (2019-2024)."
2. Bad: "GNNs"
   Better: "I want to write a paper about graph neural networks for molecular property prediction, focusing on benchmarks and generalization."
3. Bad: "Climate change"
   Better: "I want to write a proposal about carbon capture using metal-organic frameworks, focusing on adsorption mechanisms and scalability."

**Manual Search Field**
- Paste a single DOI or arXiv ID only.
- Examples: `10.1145/3290605.3300233`, `2301.01234`
