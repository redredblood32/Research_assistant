# Query Guide

This app works best when the **Research Topic** is specific enough to guide section planning and academic search queries. Use the patterns below to frame effective topics.

**Best Practices**
- Start with a clear topic or problem area.
- Add scope: domain, population, geography, or application.
- Add constraints: timeframe, methods, or evaluation focus.
- Include key synonyms or alternate terms if they are common in the literature.
- Keep it to one primary topic (avoid unrelated combined topics).

**Good Examples**
- Generative agents in social simulations: evaluation methods and emergent behavior metrics (2018-2025)
- LLM-based clinical decision support in radiology: accuracy, safety, and regulation (2019-2024)
- Graph neural networks for molecular property prediction: benchmark datasets and generalization
- Privacy-preserving federated learning in healthcare: threat models and mitigation strategies
- Carbon capture using metal-organic frameworks: adsorption mechanisms and scalability
- Real-time sentiment analysis for financial markets: model drift and deployment constraints
- Neural retrieval-augmented generation: hallucination mitigation and citation quality

**Rewrite These**
1. Bad: "AI in healthcare"
   Better: "LLM-based clinical decision support in radiology: accuracy, safety, and regulation (2019-2024)"
2. Bad: "GNNs"
   Better: "Graph neural networks for molecular property prediction: benchmark datasets and generalization"
3. Bad: "Climate change"
   Better: "Carbon capture using metal-organic frameworks: adsorption mechanisms and scalability"

**Manual Search Field**
- Paste a single DOI or arXiv ID only.
- Examples: `10.1145/3290605.3300233`, `2301.01234`
